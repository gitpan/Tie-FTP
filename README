NAME
    Tie::FTP - A module to open files on FTP servers as filehandles

SYNOPSIS
            tie *FH,'Tie::FTP';

            open FH,'ftp://user:password@host/file';

            print while (<FH>);

            seek FH,0,0;
            print FH foo;
            close FH;

    Or

            tie *FH,'Tie::FTP';
        
            (tied *FH)->taint;
            my $fh = (tied *FH)->tmpfh;
        
            seek $fh,0,0;
            print $fh foo;
            close FH;

DESCRIPTION
    This module downloads a file on an FTP server into a temporary file, and
    allows editing on that. Upon destroy the object rewrites itself to the
    server if there were any write operations.

AVOIDING THE TIE INTERFACE
    Since all the operations are actually delegated you're better off tying
    a gensym, and then using "my $fh = (tied $ftpfh)->tmpfh;". Just remember
    to call "(tied $ftpfh)->taint;" if you want to commit changes at DESTROY
    time.

METHODS
    TIEHANDLE
        This method accepts either a URI string or object, or a logged in
        Net::FTP object and a path string.

        In the former all login credentials are sucked out of the URI, and a
        Net::FTP object is created. See CAVEATS.

        In the latter form the Net::FTP object is assumed to be connected,
        and the path string is a relative one.

CAVEATS
    The file will be written regardless of wether or not there are write
    permissions.

    You may need to do "(tied $ftpfh)->ftp->noop;" every once in a while, to
    stir things up.

    Net::FTP and URI are not used from within the module as you may prefer
    to pass other types of objects, with a compatible interface.
